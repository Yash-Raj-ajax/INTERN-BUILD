      This is about page where I will describe the game I made to qualify for
      Assignment Round, It may sound like a basic game starter game. Still, some
      features make it attractive which are a login and signup page for the game
      players but that's just the surface I've done my best to hash my password
      and also applied JWT and salt/pepper logic to keep the user's password and
      account safe from potential hackers, well leave that. Im going to explain
      more in the GitHub ReadMe.
